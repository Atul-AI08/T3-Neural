# T3-Neural

T3-Neural is an advanced Tic Tac Toe project that features Reinforcement Learning (RL) bots trained using Q-learning to play as `X` and `O`. The project integrates a modern frontend built using Angular 17 with a backend powered by FastAPI for deploying the trained RL models. The RL models are implemented in PyTorch and trained on randomly generated games to master Tic Tac Toe strategies.

## Features

- **RL-Powered Bots**: Intelligent bots for `X` and `O` trained using Q-learning.
- **Frontend**: An interactive and responsive UI built with Angular 17.
- **Backend**: A FastAPI-based backend for serving the trained PyTorch models.
- **Training Pipeline**: Models trained on randomly generated games to ensure comprehensive learning of Tic Tac Toe strategies.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with modern web browsers for a seamless experience.

## How It Works

1. The frontend allows users to play Tic Tac Toe against RL bots.
2. Bots are served via the backend, which uses PyTorch models trained with Q-learning.
3. The game states are processed in real-time, and bots make moves based on their learned policies.
4. Users can interact with the game and analyze the bot's strategies.
